<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
Almost a year ago, I wrote a post I called the [Big Data Brain Drain](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/), lamenting the ways that academia is neglecting the skills of modern data-intensive research, and in doing so is driving away many of the men and women who are perhaps best equipped to enable progress in these fields. This seemed to strike a chord with a wide range of people, and has led me to some incredible opportunities for conversation and collaboration on the subject. One of those conversations took place this past weekend at the annual SciFoo conference, and this article is my way of recording some reflections on that conversation.

[SciFoo](http://www.digital-science.com/sciencefoo/) is an annual gathering of several hundred scientists, writers, and thinkers sponsored by Digital Science, Nature, O'Reilly Media & Google. SciFoo brings together an incredibly eclectic group of people: I met and spoke with philosophers, futurists, alien hunters, quantum physicists, mammoth cloners, journal editors, science funders, astrophysicists, musicians, mycologists, mesmerists, and many many more: the list could go on and on. The conference is about as unstructured as it can be: the organizers simply provide food, drink, and a venue for conversation, and attendees put together breakout discussions on nearly any imaginable topic. If you ever get the chance to go, my advice is to drop everything else and attend. It was one of the most intellectually stimulating weekends I've ever had.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

SciFoo is by invitation only, and given the incredible work other folks I met there I'm still not quite sure how I ended up on the invite list (the first evening, my imposter syndrome was registering off-the-charts!) With so many excellent thinkers around, though, I decided to team-up with Chris Mentzel, Program director of the [Moore Foundation](http://www.moore.org/), and lead a session: we called it *Hacking Academia from Inside and Out*. The session was in many ways a conversation around the general topic of my *Big Data Brain Drain* post, though it was clear that many of the folks in attendance had been thinking in these terms long before I penned that particular essay.

## The Problem
The problem we discussed is laid out in some detail in my *Brain Drain* post, but a quick summary is this: scientific research in many disciplines is becoming more and more dependent on the careful analysis of large datasets. This analysis requires a skill-set as broad as it is deep: scientists must be experts not only in their own domain knowledge, but in statistics, computing, algorithm building, and software design as well. Many researchers are working hard to attain these skills and do good work; the problem is that academia's reward structure is not well-poised to recognize the value of this type of work. In short, time developing good, reusable software tools translates to less time writing and publishing, which in the current system leads to little hope for career advancement.

In my *Brain Drain* post, I observed the rise of data-intensive researchand lamented that researchers with the requisite interdisciplinary knowledge are largely unrecognized and unrewarded in academia, even as they are highly-sought-after in the tech industry.
I previously labeled this type of person a "new breed of scientist": a bit of a mouthful. Since then, it's become clear to me that the working label for this type of person seems to have become (for better or worse) a *data scientist*.


## Defining Data Science
The term "Data Science" generally seems to get a bad rap: it's variously dismissed as [misleading](http://insideanalysis.com/2013/08/a-data-science-rant/), an [empty buzzword](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/08/19/data-science-whats-the-half-life-of-a-buzzword/), or begrudgingly conceeded to be [flawed, but useful](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/data-science-terminology.html). Perhaps "Data Scientist" can be understood as just a more subdued term for the ["sexy statisticians"](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/technology/06stats.html) that Hal Varian predicted would emerge this decade. I think the best illustration of data science's definition comes from Drew Conway's (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) [Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), which applies the label "Data Science" to the intersection of hacking skills, statistical knowledge, and domain expertise.

The key is that there is both a breadth and a depth to the knowledge and skill-set involved. In the words of Alex Szalay, these sorts of researchers must be "Pi-shaped" as opposed to the more traditional "T-shaped" researcher:

A classic PhD program generates "T-shaped" researchers: scientists with a shallow breadth of knowledge, but deep skill and expertise in one particular area.
The new breed of scientific researchers, the data scientists, must be "Pi-shaped": that is, they maintain the breadth of knowledge, but push deeper in their own subject area and in the statistical or computational methods that help drive modern research.

Regardless of what metaphor, definition, or label you apply to this class of researcher, it is clear that their skill set is highly valuable in both academia and industry: the Brain Drain comes from the unfortunate fact that academia fails to properly reward this valuable skillset.

## Our Discussion: Academia and Data Science
With this label in mind, our SciFoo discussion focused largely around the following questions:

1. Where does Data Science fit among the current plurality of academic departments?
2. What is it that academic data scientists want from their job? How can academia offer that?
3. Recognizing that not all students will end up in academia, how do we best prepare them for life after their degree?
4. What are the drivers that can shift academia to recognizing & rewarding data scientists in domain fields?


## Hacking Academia
The title of this article, "Hacking Academia", is a phrase I borrowed from Chris Mentzel's one-line description of his work. Chris has been one of the key people spearheading the recent [Moore-Sloan Data Science Initiative](http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/data-science-environments) which recently awarded a 5-year joint grant to University of Washington, University of California Berkeley, and New York University.

Chris and others at the Moore and Sloan foundations have 





Goals:
- Money
- Advancement
- Respect
- Flexibility
- Stability
- Teaching (some yes, some no)

What is data science?
- New Field?
- Applied CS? (compare to Applied Math, Applied Physics)
- Fourth Paradigm?

Initiatives:
2005: Harvard "Initiative for Advanced Computing"
2013: Moore/Sloan Data Science Initiative
2013: Michigan State "Applied Computational Systems"
